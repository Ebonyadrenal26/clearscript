# Changelog

All notable changes to clearscript will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.9] - 2026-04-26

### Three concrete user complaints, three concrete fixes

User reported running v0.0.8 with their first real transcript:

> 1. 我看不到正在跑的进程
> 2. 公司名（DeFi、Tabby、OpenCloud 等）应该自动识别
> 3. Output 实际消耗的 token 比预估多。实际花了多少钱要告诉我

### Added — Token-level live streaming

The chunk progress in v0.0.8 only showed "calling model…" with frozen 0 counters until the chunk completed. Now LLM output streams in word-by-word as it's generated.

- New ``Provider.chat_with_progress()`` yielding ``('delta', text)`` for each token chunk plus a final ``('done', ChatResponse)`` carrying real usage.
- ``AnthropicProvider`` and ``OpenAICompatProvider`` (DeepSeek/Moonshot/Qwen/etc.) implement this with **real** input/output token counts captured from streaming usage. ``OpenAICompatProvider`` sets ``stream_options={"include_usage": True}`` so DeepSeek emits a final usage chunk. Other adapters fall back to the base class's char-count estimation.
- ``Pipeline.iter_events`` now emits ``chunk_delta`` events alongside ``chunk_start`` / ``chunk_done``. The SSE endpoint forwards them.
- Web UI Editor: when a delta arrives, append it to the output textarea live (textarea is now active during streaming, not pre-disabled). Auto-scroll to follow the stream. The progress label flips to "receiving…" mid-stream.

### Added — Universal seed pack

A curated set of common ASR errors ships with clearscript and auto-loads on first use, so the model catches well-known mishears without any prior training:

- 17 terms covering AI/infra companies (Dify ← DeFi/底牌/Difan, Manus ← Minus, Tavily ← Tabby, OpenClaw ← OpenCloud, Mem0 ← MAM-9/Mem9, Nebius, PingCAP ← PinkCup, Exa ← Alexa, Brave ← Braun, Anthropic ← iShopee), tech terms (JavaScript ← Dust Script, web search ← WebSphere, E-E-A-T ← EAT), and management vocabulary (skip level ← scalable, PMF, GEO, SLG)
- 3 negative-list rules (preserve "蛮好的" / "做事情" / approximate-number phrasing)
- Loaded by ``install_seed_pack(library, only_if_empty=True)`` — won't overwrite a user's existing data on subsequent boots
- Module: ``src/clearscript/library/seed_pack.py``
- Server installs on first ``open_library()`` call per process

### Added — Actual cost reporting

Pre-run estimate kept lying about output token counts. Now both shown:

- New ``actual_cost(provider_type, model, input_tokens, output_tokens)`` in ``core/cost.py``
- After a streaming run, the SSE ``saved`` event carries the actual cost dict computed from real token usage
- Status line now shows ``Done in 28s · 8,400 tokens · 11 changes · 4 suggestions · cost: $0.0123 actual · saved as 2026-04-26-…``
- The actual cost is also persisted to the project's ``meta.json`` so the Projects tab can show it later
- Pre-run estimate's ``output_ratio`` bumped from 1.0 → 1.5 (better matches real verbose-model output)

### Tightened — L3 ASR prompt

Added a "Be proactive about company / product names" section to ``layers/l3_asr_fix.md``: explicit instruction to actively flag CamelCase / weirdly-spelled / context-misfit tokens, propose fixes for ≥75% confidence cases, add to SUGGESTIONS for <75%. Reasoning: missed real ASR errors cost more than wrong proposals the user can reject.

### Tests

- 97 still passing (MockProvider + RotatingMockProvider + DupSuggestProvider extended with ``chat_with_progress``).

### Changed

- Default ``Pipeline.max_tokens``: 16,384 (unchanged from v0.0.8 — was a v0.0.8 fix)
- Bumped to ``0.0.9``

## [0.0.8] - 2026-04-26

### Added — streaming progress + cancel button

The biggest UX wound was the 60-180s blind spinner on long runs. Closed.

- **`POST /api/run-stream`** SSE endpoint emits five named events: `plan`, `chunk_start`, `chunk_done`, `complete`, `saved` (plus `error` on failure). Same input contract as `/api/run`; same project persistence.
- **`Pipeline.iter_events()`** generator yields a `StreamEvent` per chunk transition. The synchronous `run_on_transcript()` is now a thin wrapper that consumes the events and returns the final `EditResult`. One source of truth for chunk orchestration.
- **Web UI progress panel** appears during text-input runs: progress bar (filled by `chunk_done` events), live counters for `tokens in / tokens out / changes accumulated`, current label like "Chunk 3 of 8 — calling model…". Visible the whole way, not just at the end.
- **Cancel button** in the progress header. Aborts the in-flight `fetch()` via AbortController; the server detects the disconnect and stops issuing more chunks.
- Binary-file uploads (`.docx`) keep using the existing non-streaming `/api/run-file` endpoint.

### Added — DeepSeek v4 model defaults

DeepSeek shipped v4 in 2026; the old `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` aliases are gone from `/v1/models`.

- Default DeepSeek model is now `deepseek-v4-pro`. Known list: `["deepseek-v4-pro", "deepseek-v4-flash"]`.
- `core/cost.py` price table includes both v4 entries (best-known approximations — verify at the official pricing page).

### Fixed

- **Output truncation** when the model hits the response cap: default `max_tokens` raised from 8,192 → 16,384. SUGGESTIONS section was getting cut off with verbose models.
- **Slug pollution** by mic-check pleasantries: `_slug_hint_from_input` now skips lines like "测一下麦", "听得见吗", "hello can you hear", "好的", and similarly low-information openings. Now prioritizes title → filename → briefing → first non-pleasantry transcript line. Project slugs no longer end up like `2026-04-26-…-测一下麦-听得见吗-听得见`.

### Changed

- `Pipeline._run_multi_chunk` removed. The streaming generator now drives both code paths.
- Bumped to `0.0.8`.

### Tests

- Existing 97 tests pass against the refactored pipeline (the streaming generator is the new internal driver). Lint clean.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-04-26

### Added — trust + iteration

- **Inline-editable cleaned output** in the Editor view: editable textarea, debounced auto-save (~700ms), with "saved / saving… / save failed / offline" status indicator.
- **Diff view** toggle (Edit / Diff). Each change_log entry's `new` value gets highlighted in Bauhaus colors layered by edit type:
  - L1 speaker = light blue · L3 ASR fix = light red · L3.5 sentence = orange · L5 format = blue-grey · L6 punct = light yellow
  - Hover any highlight to see the change reason and the chunk index it came from.
- **Cost preview** updates live above the Run button as you type / change provider. Curated price table covers anthropic (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku 4.x), openai (gpt-4o, o1), openai-compat (DeepSeek, Moonshot, Qwen, Kimi), Google (Gemini), Ollama (always free).
- **Project detail editable**: same auto-save pattern in the Cleaned sub-tab of an opened past project.
- New endpoints: `POST /api/estimate-cost`, `PATCH /api/projects/{slug}/transcript` (invalidates any cached .docx so the next download regenerates from the edited markdown).
- All download / copy buttons (.md / .docx / clipboard) now use the **current textarea content**, not the stale original LLM output.

### Tests

- 12 new tests across `test_cost.py` (price table coverage, CJK token estimation, Ollama free path, unknown-model fallback) and `test_project_update.py` (PATCH success, 404 path, docx cache invalidation, cost endpoint round-trip).
- Total: 97 tests, all passing. Lint clean.

### Changed

- The v0.0.6 chunks-stat card that the ruff format pass had silently dropped is restored. The stat grid is now correctly 5 columns: In / Out / Changes / Chunks / Latency.
- Bumped to `0.0.7`.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-26

### Added — long transcripts no longer crash

- **Auto-chunking** for long transcripts. ``Pipeline.run_on_transcript`` analyzes input size and, if it exceeds 6000 estimated tokens, splits it into ~3500-token chunks at speaker-turn boundaries. Each chunk runs through the same prompts; outputs are stitched back together.
- New module: ``src/clearscript/core/chunking.py`` with ``plan_chunks()``, ``estimate_tokens()``, configurable thresholds. Token estimation handles ASCII (chars/4) and CJK (chars/1.5) accurately enough for routing decisions.
- Boundary preference: speaker turn → sentence boundary (`.?。!?！？`) → hard char cut. Oversized single segments (e.g., a 30-minute monologue) are split internally on sentence boundaries.
- **Stitching logic**: edited markdown concatenated with ``\n\n``; change logs accumulated across chunks (each entry tagged with its ``chunk`` index for audit); suggestions deduped by ``(kind, canonical|canonical_name|title)`` so repeated proposals across chunks collapse.
- **Web UI**: stat panel adds a blue "Chunks" card next to In / Out / Changes / Latency. Status line on multi-chunk runs shows ``… · N chunks · ...``.
- **EditResult.num_chunks** and **RunResponse.num_chunks** so downstream consumers (UI, projects) can audit the path.
- Per-chunk change-log entries get a ``chunk`` field so the change log reads as: chunk 1 → 5 changes, chunk 2 → 8 changes, etc.

### Configurable

```python
Pipeline(
    provider=p, model=m,
    chunk_target_tokens=3500,    # aim per chunk
    chunk_trigger_tokens=6000,   # don't chunk below this
    chunk_hard_max_tokens=5000,  # split a single segment if it exceeds this
)
```

Defaults are tuned so ~30-minute interviews stay single-shot, 60+ minute ones split.

### Tests

- 11 new tests across `test_chunking.py` (token estimation, boundary preference, oversized-segment internal split, empty input, metadata preservation) and `test_pipeline_chunked.py` (multi-chunk path, single-chunk path, suggestion dedup, token-count summing).
- Total: 85 tests, all passing. Lint clean.

### Deferred to v0.0.7

- **Mode C cross-chunk learning**: chunk N's user-confirmed corrections feeding into chunk N+1's prompt. Requires multi-stage pipeline with batch-ask. Tracked.
- **Streaming progress (SSE)**: real-time "chunk 3/12 done" updates instead of waiting for the full multi-chunk run. Tracked.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-25

### Added — every Run is now a project

- **Project history**: every successful Run auto-saves to `~/Documents/clearscript/projects/<slug>/` with the original input, briefing (if any), cleaned markdown, change log, library suggestions, and a `meta.json` summary. No data loss when you close the browser.
- **Slug format**: `2026-04-25-143012-acme-cto-interview` — date + seconds-precision time + best-effort title from the briefing/filename. Two runs in the same minute can't collide.
- **Projects tab in the web UI** — third top-nav tab between Library and the Editor. Bauhaus-styled split layout: list on the left (with format pill, date, token count, change count), detail panel on the right with five sub-tabs (Cleaned / Raw input / Change log / Suggestions / Briefing). Per-row download buttons (`.md` / `.docx` / raw input) and delete.
- **`POST /api/run` and `/api/run-file`** now return a `project_slug` so the editor's success status line shows where the run was saved.
- **Server endpoints** for the Projects tab:
  - `GET /api/projects` (list summaries)
  - `GET /api/projects/{slug}` (full detail)
  - `DELETE /api/projects/{slug}`
  - `GET /api/projects/{slug}/transcript.md` (download cleaned output)
  - `GET /api/projects/{slug}/transcript.docx` (auto-generated from the saved markdown on first request)
  - `GET /api/projects/{slug}/input` (download original raw input)
- **CLI**: new `clearscript projects` subcommand:
  - `clearscript projects list [--limit N]`
  - `clearscript projects show <slug> [--json]`
  - `clearscript projects delete <slug> [-y]`
  - `clearscript projects path` (prints the projects root)

### Changed

- Editor success status now shows `… · saved as <slug>` when persistence worked, so you can immediately tell where to find the run.
- Web UI hash routing extended to `#editor` / `#library` / `#projects`. Refresh-friendly.
- Bumped to `0.0.5`.

### Tests

- 8 new unit tests in `test_projects.py` covering: full save round-trip, summary extraction, detail payload assembly, list-newest-first sort, delete + idempotent re-delete, second-precision slug uniqueness, binary-input bytes round-trip without crashing the detail view.
- Total: 74 tests, all passing. Lint clean.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-25

### Added — feed it your real transcripts

- **5 new ingest adapters** for the formats real ASR tools produce:
  - `.md` (`MdAdapter`) — auto-detect and strip AI-summary blocks. Recognizes English (`# Summary`, `## Action items`, `## TL;DR`) and Chinese (`## 本次访谈总结`, `## 会议要点`, `## 摘要`, `## 后续待办`). Strips tool provenance lines.
  - `.docx` (`DocxAdapter`) — covers 飞书妙记 / 腾讯会议 / 通义听悟 / generic Word. Detects bold-leading-run speaker pattern. Strips inline timestamps `[00:14:33]`.
  - `.srt` (`SrtAdapter`) — SubRip subtitles. Cue start/end seconds preserved on segments. Inline `Speaker: text` patterns extracted; HTML/ASS styling stripped.
  - `.vtt` (`VttAdapter`) — WebVTT, custom parser. Honors `<v Speaker>...</v>` voice tags as canonical speaker labels.
  - `.json` (`JsonAdapter`) — multi-shape: OpenAI Whisper / PLAUD / Google STT / Deepgram / generic flat list. Surfaces ASR-reported confidence when present.
- **`POST /api/run-file`** — multipart upload endpoint for binary formats (`.docx`).
- **`GET /api/supported-formats`** — extension list endpoint for the frontend.
- **Web UI multi-format input** — drop zone now accepts `.txt / .md / .markdown / .docx / .srt / .vtt / .json`; binary uploads show a yellow "📎 file pending" badge and route through `/api/run-file`; text uploads still load into the textarea with format hint preserved.
- `supported_extensions()` helper exposed from `clearscript.ingest`.

### Changed

- `RunRequest` gains a `format` field driving parser selection.
- Ingest registry order: `md → docx → srt → vtt → json → txt`.
- New runtime dependency: `python-multipart>=0.0.9`.
- Bumped to `0.0.4`.

### Tests

- 22 new format tests across `test_ingest_md.py`, `test_ingest_docx.py`, `test_ingest_srt.py`, `test_ingest_vtt.py`, `test_ingest_json.py`.
- Total: 66 tests, all passing. Lint clean.

### Caught and fixed during testing

- JSON: `s.get("start") or s.get("begin")` returned `None` when start was `0.0` (Python truthiness). Now uses explicit `is not None` checks.
- Markdown: summary-block stripping treated `## Subsection` under `# Summary` as nested-skip; should end the skip. Now ends on any non-summary heading or first speaker line.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-25

### Added — the library is alive

- **Library tab in the web UI** with three sub-tabs (Terms / Speakers / Edit patterns), each with a sortable table, search, type/status/domain filters, an inline add form, and per-row delete. Status rendered with Bauhaus-colored dots.
- **Library stats strip** at the top of the Library tab: 8 metric cards (terms / verified / confirmed / proposed / speakers / patterns / negatives / sessions).
- **Mode A (project-start activation)**: the briefing field is scanned for entity tokens (CamelCase, acronyms, CJK names) and each is looked up in the library; matches inject "Term mappings from your library" and "Briefing speakers" sections into the LLM system prompt. `lookup_alias` now also matches by canonical, not just aliases.
- **Mode B (end-of-session harvest)**: the layered-edit prompt now produces a `---SUGGESTIONS---` block alongside `---CHANGELOG---`. Pipeline parses it into `EditResult.suggestions`. The web UI displays a yellow panel after each run with checkboxes; "Accept selected → library" bulk-writes to terms / speakers / patterns.

### Added — Library class API

- `list_terms(type_, domain, status, search, limit)` — filtered listing including all aliases per row
- `update_term(id, ...)` and `delete_term(id)`
- `list_speakers(search, limit)`, `update_speaker`, `delete_speaker`
- `list_edit_patterns(domain)`, `add_edit_pattern(...)`, `delete_edit_pattern(id)`
- `add_negative(text, do_not_change_to, domain, reason)` (NULL-safe dedupe), `list_negatives()`
- Expanded `stats()`: now includes `verified_terms`, `confirmed_terms`, `proposed_terms`, `edit_patterns`, `negative_rules`

### Added — Server API

- `GET /api/library/stats`
- `GET /api/library/terms` (with `type`, `domain`, `status`, `search`, `limit` query params)
- `POST /api/library/terms`, `PATCH /api/library/terms/{id}`, `DELETE /api/library/terms/{id}`
- `GET /api/library/speakers`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
- `GET /api/library/patterns`, `POST`, `DELETE`
- `POST /api/library/accept-suggestions` — bulk write Mode B suggestions

### Changed

- All Pydantic request models lifted to module level so FastAPI can introspect them as request bodies (was: nested in `create_app`, dropped to query params)
- `TxtAdapter.parse_string()` already public from v0.0.2 — no change here; documenting that web UI uses it for in-memory input
- Bumped version to `0.0.3`

### Tests

- 17 new unit tests covering: term filtering by type/status/search, term update/delete, speaker listing/search, edit-pattern lifecycle, negative-list NULL-safe dedupe, expanded stats schema, suggestions parsing, briefing entity extraction (CJK + CamelCase + acronyms), Mode A end-to-end, fenced-JSON parsing
- Total: 44 tests, all passing
